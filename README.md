# A game about rolling Dice

Any feedback is appreciated, whether it be good or bad.</br>
I'm not an excellent coder, and this is just a little passion project from me.

## Playing the game

### Prerequisities

You first need to install Python, this can by done from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or from the Microsoft store.</br>
You also need the curses library. You can install it on Windows by typing this in the terminal:
```
pip install windows-curses
```

### Actually playing the game

Download **main.py** from [here](https://github.com/0versc0re/A-game-about-rolling-Dice/releases/tag/v.1.6.1.3) and put it in a separate folder.</br>
This is to make sure the save file doesn't get lost.</br>
Play it by right clicking **main.py** and opening it with Python.

### old_main.py

**old_main.py** is a version without the curses library, I won't be updating it ever in the future.

## Things I may add to this game in the future

+ Multiple save files
+ Larger dice
+ Colors
+ A real tree
