# A game about rolling Dice

Any feedback is appreciated, whether it be good or bad.</br>
I'm not an excellent coder, and this is just a little passion project from me.

## Playing the game

### Prerequisities

You first need to install Python, this can by done from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or from the Microsoft store.</br>
You also need the curses library. You can install it on Windows by typing this in the terminal:
```
pip install windows-curses
```

### Actually playing the game

Download **main.py** from [here](https://github.com/0versc0re/A-game-about-rolling-Dice/releases/tag/v.1.8.6) and put it in a separate folder.</br>
This is to make sure the save files don't get lost.</br>
Play it by right clicking in the folder and clicking "Open in Terminal". Fullscreen the terminal with **F11** and then type this into the terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```

### old_main.py

**old_main.py** is a version without the curses library, I won't be updating it ever in the future.

### Save files

Save files from before version ***1.8.6*** are not compatible with ***1.8.6*** and beyond.</br>
A way to convert old save files to new save files is:
+ Copy the old save
+ Start a new game
+ Copy save data from old save into new save
+ Load the new save

## Things I may add to this game in the future

  + Option to see all saves

  + ~~Hundred~~
  + ~~Thousand~~
  + ~~Million~~
  + ~~Trillion~~
  + ~~Quintillion~~

  + Only border colors
+ Card variants
  + ~~Regular~~
  + Gold (NEWEST)
