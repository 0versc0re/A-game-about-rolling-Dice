# A game about rolling Dice

Play the game by right-clicking the file and opening it with Python.</br>
Your game is saved on a JSON file so editing it should be a piece of cake.</br>
Any suggestions on making this abomination better is appreciated.</br>
</br>
As of 1.6.0, you now need the curses -library.</br>
For Windows, run "pip install windows-curses" on the command line.</br>
For Linux, run "pip install curses" (I don't have a Linux machine, so this is just a guess).</br>
</br>
"old_main.py" Latest version is 1.5.3</br>

BE WARNED</br>
THE HELP OF CHATGPT HAS BEEN UTILIZED IN THE MAKING OF THIS GAME, BUT DON'T BE SCARED, CHATGPT HAS CONTRIBUTED LITTLE
